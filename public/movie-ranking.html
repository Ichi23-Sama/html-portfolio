<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</h3>
<p>The greatest film ever made began with the meeting of two brilliant minds: 
    Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi seer Arthur C Clarke. ‘I understand 
    he’s a nut who lives in a tree in India somewhere,’ noted Kubrick when 
    Clarke’s name came up – along with those of Isaac Asimov, Robert A Heinlein 
    and Ray Bradbury – as a possible writer for his planned sci-fi epic. 
    Clarke was actually living in Ceylon (not in India, or a tree), but the pair met, 
    hit it off, and forged a story of technological progress and disaster (hello, HAL) 
    that’s steeped in humanity, in all its brilliance, weakness, courage and mad ambition. 
    An audience of stoners, wowed by its eye-candy Star Gate sequence and pioneering visuals, 
    adopted it as a pet movie. Were it not for them, 2001 might have faded into obscurity,
     but it’s hard to imagine it would have stayed there. Kubrick’s frighteningly clinical 
     vision of the future – AI and all – still feels prophetic, 
     more than 50 years on.—Phil de Semlyen</p>


<h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<p>From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, 
    all crime dynasties that came after The Godfather are descendants of the Corleones: 
    Francis Ford Coppola’s magnum opus is the ultimate patriarch of the Mafia genre. 
    A monumental opening line (“I believe in America”) sets the operatic Mario Puzo adaptation in motion, 
    before Coppola’s epic morphs into a chilling dismantling of the American dream. 
    The corruption-soaked story follows a powerful immigrant family grappling with 
    the paradoxical values of reign and religion; those moral contradictions are crystallized 
    in a legendary baptism sequence, superbly edited in parallel to the murdering of four rivaling dons. 
    With countless iconic details—a horse’s severed head, Marlon Brando’s wheezy voice, 
    Nino Rota’s catchy waltz—The Godfather’s authority lives on.—Tomris Laffly</p>

    
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</h3>
<p>ased on the true story of Jordan Belfort, from his rise to a wealthy stock-broker living the high life to his fall involving crime, corruption and the federal government.</p>
